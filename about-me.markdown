My name is Julien Debon (usually Sir4ur0n online), I am a Haskell (previously Java) developer and I enjoy Functional programming and Quality (and I think the former favors the latter).

My main public contact point is [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sir4ur0n), feel free to send a DM if you want to get in touch!
